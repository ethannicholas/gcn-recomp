//
// Parsing the command stream, decoding vertices and building pixel state can be half of
// the guest thread's time in a scene with many small draws. The hardware runs its
// GPU alongside the CPU off the same FIFO, and a game synchronises with it only through
// what the GPU signals back -- PE tokens and draw-done -- so the front end can run on a
// thread of its own as long as those signals stay where they were.
//
// So the guest thread skims (gx::skim): it walks the commands, copies every complete one
// into a queue -- display lists inlined, since their memory may be reused -- and keeps
// the frame protocol: at a finish it waits until the front end has caught up to that
// command, and a token read waits until the front end has reached the token it returns
// (see "draw-sync lag" and pe_read16); either signal is raised by the guest thread itself,
// at the same guest instruction as when the front end ran inline, which keeps replays
// exact. Vertex arrays and textures are
// still read when the front end gets to the draw, as the hardware reads them; a game that
// rewrites one before the GPU has signalled that it is done with it is already racing
// the hardware. The display copy that ends a frame is counted by the skim too, since
// scripted input and the guest checks key on it.
