// What a game tells the headset frontends (android/openxr_main.cpp, android/egl_main.cpp).
//
// The frontends know how to put a frame on a panel, how to draw it per eye, and how to
// morph between the two. When to do which, how big the world is, and where else an eye
// might stand are facts about a game. A game project supplies them by calling
// vr::set_game_hooks from a static initializer in one of its SOURCES (gcn_add_game);
// every hook is optional. This lives in the runtime rather than beside the frontends so
// that the desktop build carries the hooks too: GCN_STEREOLOG=1 there prints what
// wants_stereo answers, against frames that can be dumped and looked at.
