# gcn-recomp

A toolkit for static recompilation of Nintendo GameCube games to native code: a Gekko
PowerPC → C recompiler, and a runtime that stands in for the GameCube hardware (CPU helpers,
OS context switching, graphics through an OpenGL GX pipeline, audio, DVD, controllers,
memory card) with an SDL desktop frontend.

It is the common layer under per-game projects, each of which supplies its own game's
layout and steering files and nothing else:

- [prime-recomp](https://github.com/ethannicholas/prime-recomp) — *Metroid Prime*
- [bluestorm-recomp](https://github.com/ethannicholas/bluestorm-recomp) — *Wave Race: Blue
  Storm*, where this code was first written

**This repository contains no game code or data.** A game project builds from the user's
own disc image; the recompiled C lands in that project's build directory and nowhere else.

## Using it from a game project

Add this repository as a submodule and call `gcn_add_game()`:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(prime C CXX)
add_subdirectory(gcn-recomp)
gcn_add_game(
  NAME prime
  TITLE "Metroid Prime"
  DISC_ID GM8E01
  DOL_SHA1 39a2f928159ad46491e9b1ef0a72613d91e0cc40
  SYMBOLS ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/analysis/symbols.txt
  TABLES ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/recomp
  FPS 60)
```

That defines the game executable, a headless benchmark (`<name>_bench`) and a compile-only
`runtime_check` target. The game project provides:

- `analysis/symbols.txt` — the DOL's function layout in decomp-toolkit's format, either
  from `dtk dol split` (`tools/fetch_dtk.sh` downloads it) or from a decompilation project.
- `recomp/hle.txt` — functions whose body the runtime replaces (`OSSaveContext`,
  `OSLoadContext`, `OSReport`, `OSPanic` at minimum).
- `recomp/special_calls.txt` — the address of `OSSaveContext`, whose call sites become
  resume points.
- `recomp/names.txt`, `recomp/patches.txt` — hand-named functions and instruction patches,
  usually empty.

## Layout

- `recomp/`: `recomp.py` drives the translation; `ppc.py` turns each instruction into C;
  `dol.py` reads DOLs, `.iso` and `.ciso` images and symbol files; `extract_dol.py` pulls
  and verifies the DOL.
- `runtime/`: the GameCube in software. `recomp.h` is the contract with generated code.
  `cpu.cpp`, `threads.cpp` and `hle_os.cpp` are the CPU and OS; `hw/` the hardware
  registers; `gx/` the graphics pipeline; `main.cpp` the SDL frontend and `bench_main.cpp`
  the benchmark.
- `docs/`: working notes on diagnostics and the renderer.

## Requirements

CMake 3.20+, Ninja, Python 3, a C++20 compiler, SDL2 (via pkg-config; built from source on
Windows). On macOS: `brew install cmake ninja sdl2 python`.
